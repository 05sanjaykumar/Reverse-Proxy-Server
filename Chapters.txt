## ✅ What You've Done *IS* a Reverse Proxy
Let’s check the boxes:

| Feature                         | Your Proxy |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Accepts incoming HTTP requests  | ✅          |
| Forwards request to a backend   | ✅          |
| Receives response from backend  | ✅          |
| Sends response back to client   | ✅          |

This is already **everything a basic reverse proxy** does.

So yes — at its heart, it **is this much only**.  
But here’s where it gets interesting...

## 🚀 What Real Reverse Proxies Add on Top

As real-world complexity grows, reverse proxies evolve into *full-blown beasts*. Here's what gets added on top:

### 1. **Concurrency**
- Handle many simultaneous clients, not just one.
- Threads, `fork()`, or I/O multiplexing (`select()`, `poll()`, or `epoll()` in Linux).

### 2. **Load Balancing**
- Forward requests to **multiple** backend servers.
- Add round-robin, least-connections, or sticky sessions.

### 3. **Timeouts and Retries**
- What if a backend takes too long or crashes?
- Retry a different server or show an error gracefully.

### 4. **Caching**
- Store common responses temporarily and serve them directly.
- Reduces backend load massively.

### 5. **Header Rewriting**
- Add/remove/modify HTTP headers for logging, security, etc.
- Example: inject `X-Forwarded-For`, strip cookies, etc.

### 6. **TLS / HTTPS Termination**
- Accept HTTPS traffic, decrypt it at the proxy, and forward plain HTTP to backend.
- Useful for centralizing TLS certs.

### 7. **Rate Limiting / Throttling**
- Prevent abuse (too many requests from a single IP).

### 8. **Request Inspection**
- Modify request bodies (e.g., replace JSON fields).
- Implement security rules (e.g., block based on user-agent).

## 🛠️ You Built the Engine, Now Add the Bodywork

What you’ve done is like **writing the engine of a car**. It *runs*, and it’s already amazing.

Now you get to decide:
- Do I want a simple, reliable engine?
- Or do I want to build a turbocharged, feature-rich ride?

Each new feature is a puzzle that teaches more about networking, memory, concurrency, and systems.

Wanna level this up with:
- 🔁 Concurrency?
- ⚖️ Load balancing?
- 🔐 Basic HTTPS handling?
- 📜 Logging and analytics?

Pick one and we’ll build it together, piece by piece.
